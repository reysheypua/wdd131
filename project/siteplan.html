        <h1>The Gamification Lab | Site Plan</h1>
        <p>Analyzing the Psychology of Play in Design</p>
    </header>

    <div class="section-box">
        <h2>Site Name</h2>
        <p><strong>Site Name:</strong> The Gamification Lab</p>
        <p><strong>Logo Idea:</strong> A minimalist icon of a "progress bar" filling up, perhaps with a brain or gear inside.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The name is professional yet intriguing. "Gamification" directly states the subject, and "Lab" suggests a scientific, analytical approach to research and demystification, fitting the site's purpose of exploring the psychology behind design.</p>
        <p><strong>Optional Domain Suggestion:</strong> <code>game-lab.org</code> or <code>gamification-lab.com</code></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-box">
        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>The site serves as an educational and analytical hub focused on the application of game design elements in non-game contexts. It provides clear definitions, breakdowns of psychological principles (like intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation), and real-world case studies of successful and ethical gamification.</p>
        <p><strong>Services/Information Provided:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>In-depth articles explaining key psychological mechanics (e.g., Loss Aversion, Variable Rewards).</li>
            <li>Case studies analyzing popular apps (Duolingo, fitness trackers, etc.).</li>
            <li>An HTML Form for users to submit their own gamification examples or questions for review.</li>
            <li>Ethical guidelines for responsible motivational design.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The overall goal is to demystify how these systems work so users can understand and control their own engagement.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-box">
        <h2>Scenarios (Target Audience Questions)</h2>
        <p>The target audience includes students, designers, and general users curious about technology and motivation.</p>
        <p><strong>Scenario 1: Student/Aspiring Designer</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Question: "What is the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and how do I use a progress bar effectively in my own app design?"</li>
            <li>Content Drive: This requires a detailed page on Motivation Theory and a page on Mechanics explaining the Zeigarnik Effect (the tendency to complete an unfinished task).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Scenario 2: General User/Curious Consumer</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Question: "Why do I feel so stressed about losing my 'streak' on this app? Is that bad design, and how can I turn off those notifications?"</li>
            <li>Content Drive: This requires a section on Ethics and Dark Patterns (Loss Aversion) and a page analyzing specific popular app mechanics, offering insight and control.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-box">
